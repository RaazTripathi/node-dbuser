node-dbuser
===========

This is a node.js based application written in express and uses mongodb as a data store.
As it is more of a POC application, the emphasis is more on the technology part rather than the usability/design areas.
While trying various approaches, there is always a scope of inserting some wrong approach/design into the code or approach, so any comments/pull requests are welcomed.
Hope you find the code useful and resuable in your projects!
